    <h2>The Old G - Home Logo</h2> 
    <p>The G - Home logo above this text looks a bit different, doesn’t it? It was the original G - Home logo that we created when the old G - Home site first launched. Now, we use the modern version of the G - Home logo that we designed halfway through the development of the old G - Home website. We switched over to the new G - Home logo because of its modern design and because it is newer!</p> 
</section>

    <h2>Our Roles</h2> 
    <p>We started G - Home as a personal project within a group, with Milan (myself) as the Owner, and Arthur as the Co - Owner. Along the way, Maya joined as a Co - Owner and helped improve the website. However, she no longer plays an active role in G - Home and has resigned from Co - Owner and became a Partner. We defined roles within G - Home as follows:</p> 
    <p><strong>Owner</strong>: The highest role, responsible for creating the site. (Milan)</p>
    <p><strong>Co - Owners</strong>: Similar to the owner but with less authority. (Arthur)</p>
    <p><strong>Partners</strong>: People who contributed code, links, or other help to the G - Home website. (Maya, etc)</p>
    <p>You can actually try becoming a G - Home Partner if you contribute anything like code, links, games, or anything else like that to the G - Home website! If you get accepted, your name or username will be added to the Collabs page and listed with your contribution! Contact us through the Contacts page where you will find a Google Form in which you can try becoming a G - Home Partner.</p>

    <h2>Why We Transitioned To This New G - Home Website</h2> 
    <p>There were many reasons why we transitioned from the old G - Home website to this new G - Home website. One of the main reasons was that we lost access to publish and update the old G - Home website. The inability to publish and update the old G - Home website left us very limited. Soon after, we explained why we couldn’t edit the old G - Home website anymore at: </p> 
    <p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/the-end-of-g-home/home" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/view/the-end-of-g-home/home</a>.</p>
    <p>The reason why we lost access to publish and update the old G - Home website was because the old G - Home website had too many pages for free plan that was updated with less pages per website, the website builder informed us that we needed to remove one of our website pages. However, similar to removing a page on this new G - Home website, it was a big issue, so we decided not to do it. By that point, we were already considering shutting down the old G - Home website for good due to losing interest in it. However, we have found our interest again. This motivated us to redesign G - Home, we made this website to solve most of our issues with the old G - Home website!</p>
    <h2>The Final Straw</h2>
    <p>The final straw came when our old Great Page on Google Sites was taken down falsely. We reported the issue, and within an hour, it was restored. However, this was a wake up call for us, if someone wanted to take down G - Home, they easily could. This motivated us to redesign G - Home.</p>

    <h2>Old G - Home Hidden Links Discord Server:</h2> 
    <p>This was the old Discord server used for hidden pages on the old G - Home website. However, this Discord server is no longer in use because there are no hidden links on this site:</p> 
    <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/WnZwwCB3Kc" target="_blank">https://discord.com/invite/WnZwwCB3Kc</a>.</p>
    <h2>Official G - Home Discord Server:</h2> 
    <p>During this time, we also created the official G - Home Discord server, which we still use for this website! Here is the official G - Home Discord server link that we still use:</p>

    <h2>Hidden Pages On The Old G - Home Website</h2> 
    <p>An example of one of the hidden pages was the "Hidden Games" page, located at: </p> 
    <p><a href="https://milannikulin.website3.me/hidden-games" target="_blank">https://milannikulin.website3.me/hidden-games</a>.</p> 
    <p>This sub-website was part of the old G - Home site. It was accessible to everyone, but only if they found the link. We made it a hidden page because we didn’t want school ITs discovering the games and tools list, known as The Great Page. The old Great Page can be found at: </p> 
    <p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/great-page/home?authuser=1" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/view/great-page/home?authuser=1</a>.</p> 
    <p>This Great Page is no longer updated and has been replaced by the new Great Page on this website!</p> 
    <h2>Owner Page</h2> 
    <p>Another example of a hidden page was the owner page. This page was only accessible to owners, partners, and close friends because the link was kept a secret to make these individuals feel special. However, the new G - Home website does not have any hidden pages or secrets, and dose not have a owner page. Here is the link to the old G - Home owner page: </p> 
    <p><a href="https://milannikulin.website3.me/owner-page" target="_blank">https://milannikulin.website3.me/owner-page</a>.</p>

    <h2>Why We Are Back</h2> 
    <p>After considering shutting down G - Home for good, we realized that creating a new version of G - Home through coding would solve the problems we experienced with the old G - Home website builder! By building a new site, we gained the ability to edit it freely with multiple people and maintain full control over the content. We believe that we can make G - Home better with this remodel of the old website!</p>
    <p>We don't recommend using the old G - Home website anymore. It contains spelling mistakes, grammar issues, and an inconsistent tone. Additionally, there are several problems that we’ve fixed on the new site. The old site will no longer be updated, and even if we wanted to make updates, we would have to delete pages to do so. Instead, we decided to recreate the original G - Home website with this new G - Home website!</p>

    <p>If you haven't noticed, we used ChatGPT to help fix grammar, spelling, and improve the overall readability of this text and many like it. There were just so many spelling and grammar mistakes, and the overall flow wasn’t great, so we decided to get some help with making everything sound better lol!</p>
