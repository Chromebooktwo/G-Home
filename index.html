    <h2>Welcome to G - Home</h2>
    <p>G - Home, also known as Game Home but everyone including us calls it G - Home, is a website that serves as a game and gaming website list, where you can discover gaming websites and new games to play. G - Home is basically a website that lists many links, some games, and lists gaming websites where you can play games on.</p>

    <h2>Best Experience</h2>
    <p>For the best experience, we recommend using G - Home with a keyboard, a mouse/trackpad/touchpad, and a standard computer screen. Using a tablet, a iPad, or a phone may limit certain features, particularly on the Games page. A laptop or PC on the other hand will provide the best experience. While the site may still load on mobile devices, it will not offer the best experience, and some features may not work as intended.</p>

    <h2>About G - Home</h2>
    <p>This website is a redesign of the old G - Home website, which can be found at: <a href="https://milannikulin.website3.me/" target="_blank">https://milannikulin.website3.me/</a>. Feel free to visit and explore the old G - Home website, but please note that the old G - Home website is no longer updated and contains numerous spelling and grammar mistakes, which we hope won't be an issue on this new G - Home website. We switched to this new G - Home website due to major issues with the old G - Home website. We hope you enjoy the new G - Home website!</p>
